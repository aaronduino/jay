# Jay
> _The journal for the paranoid._

Jay is a simple command line utility to keep track of a personal journal privately and securely.

Credits to [jrnl](http://jrnl.sh) for inspiration.

## Principles
- **Simple.** It's a journal and nothing more.
- **Quick.** It's asymetrically encrypted, meaning that you need a password when _reading_ your notes, but not when you jot them down.
- **Private.** Your notes are kept locked away behind your (hopefully secure) password.
- **Secure.** Jay follows up-to-date security recommendations, using pbkdf2 and rsa 4096.
